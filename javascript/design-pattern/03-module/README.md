=========

```
The Module pattern is JavaScript's manifestation of the Gang-of-Four Singleton pattern. 
Modules are immediate functions that execute only once, their return value being the module. 
Only a single instance of the module will ever exist (which is the idea behind Singleton).
Module is so popular in the JavaScript community is because it exhibits many characteristics of 
good object-oriented design, including: information hiding, encapsulation, 
high cohesion/loose coupling, open/closed design and extensibility
