function properties a memoization pattern
=========================================

## Running / Development

```
Functions are objects, so they can have properties.
One use case for custom properties is to cache the results (the return value) of a function, so the next time the function is called, 
it doesnâ€™t have to redo potentially heavy computations. Caching the results of a function is also known as memoization.
