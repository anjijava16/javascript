immediate-functions
===================

## Running / Development

```
The pattern consists of the following parts:
You define a function using a function expression. (A function declaration won’t work)
You add a set of parentheses at the end, which causes the function to be executed immediately.
You wrap the whole function in parentheses (required only if you don’t assign the function to a variable).
```
