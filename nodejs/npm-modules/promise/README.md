```
node built-in asynchronous calls vs promise

workflow:
- read from a customers.json
- after read is done, write the read memory data to a temp.json
- after write is done, read from the temp.json.

comparison:
async - three levels deep to wait for previous action is done
promise - only one level to wait for previous action is done
```
