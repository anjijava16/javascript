self-defining-functions
=======================

## Running / Development

```
This pattern is useful when your function has some initial preparatory work to do and it needs to do it only once.
Because thereâ€™s no reason to do repeating work when it can be avoided, a portion of the function may no longer be required.
In such cases, the self- defining function can update its own implementation.
Using this pattern can obviously help with the performance of your application, because your redefined function simply does less work.
