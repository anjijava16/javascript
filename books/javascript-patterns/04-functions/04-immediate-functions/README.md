immediate-functions
===================

## Running / Development

```
The immediate function pattern is widely used. It helps you wrap an amount of work you want to do without leaving any global variables behind.
The pattern consists of the following parts:
You define a function using a function expression. (A function declaration won’t work)
You add a set of parentheses at the end, which causes the function to be executed immediately.
You wrap the whole function in parentheses (required only if you don’t assign the function to a variable).
