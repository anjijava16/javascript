factory
=======

```
The purpose of the factory is to create objects. Itâ€™s usually implemented in a class or a static method of a class, which has the following purposes:
 - Performs repeating operations when setting up similar objects
 - Offers a way for the customers of the factory to create objects without knowing the specific type (class) at compile time
