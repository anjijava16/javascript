/*
 The general rule is that properties created by the system are nonenumerable, while properties created by users are enumerable.
 Here are some best practices to keep in mind:
 For your own code, you can usually ignore enumerability and should avoid the for-in loop (Best Practices: Iterating over Arrays).
 You normally shouldnâ€™t add properties to built-in prototypes and objects.
 But if you do, you should make them nonenumerable to avoid breaking existing code.
