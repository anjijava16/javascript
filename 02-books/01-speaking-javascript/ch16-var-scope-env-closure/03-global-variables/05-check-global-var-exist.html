   There are two additional ways in which you can check via window; they are roughly equivalent, but a little more explicit.
   if (window.someVariable !== undefined) { ... }
   if ('someVariable' in window) { ... }
   The general way of checking whether a variable exists (and has a value) is via typeof.
   if (typeof someVariable !== 'undefined') { ... }
